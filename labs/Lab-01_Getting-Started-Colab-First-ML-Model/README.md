## 🎯 Lab Objectives
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Use Google Colab (run cells, restart runtime, save and share notebooks)
- Understand the difference between **code cells** and **markdown cells**
- Load and explore a dataset using **Pandas**
- Train a basic **Machine Learning classifier** using **scikit-learn**
- Evaluate results using **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**
- (Preview) Run a simple **PyTorch tensor** example
